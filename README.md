# Optimization4ML
This repository includes all codes implementation of a graduate-level optimization for machine learning course.\
It focuses on unconstrained first-order methods which are frequently used in area of machine learning and data science.
## Topics include:
1. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression.
2. Projected Gradient Descent Methods
3. Amijio Line Search for logistic regression (in matlab version)
4. proximal gradient descent
5. accelerated gradient descent (heavy-ball methods and Nesterov acceleration)
6. ADMM algorithm (rPCA for video object detection)
7. SGD algorithm: sample with/without replacement, average SGD, momentum acceleration.
## Note
For any faculties or students who want to use these codes during class or homework, you can directly use them for reference or demo.
